1. Review my logic for avoiding a pull request when the container starts

2. Will the post commit script only run on the admin node or do I need to check the environment?

3. How do I get the last commit message?
   idsh <<< "show commit list 0" and parse?

4. Put some wording around making HTTP requests from idsvr container, which is locked down.
   For demo purposes use curl and HTTP, but you can use the built in openssl tool for SSL requests.
